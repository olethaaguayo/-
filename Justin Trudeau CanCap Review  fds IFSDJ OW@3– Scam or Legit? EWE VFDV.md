<i>Canada's Justin Trudeau cites 'internal battles' as he ends his tenure as leader.</i>
<p class="m-t-25">Under growing pressure from his own party, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced he will step down and end his nine-year stretch as Canadian prime minister.</p>
<p class="m-t-25">"This country deserves a real choice in the next election and it has become clear to me that if I'm having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option in that election," he said during a press conference last week.</p>
<p class="m-t-25">Trudeau has been pressed repeatedly for specifics on the rifts inside his own cabinet. He has declined to comment on every occasion.</p>
<p class="m-t-25">In an effort to get to the bottom of the truth for our Canadian readers, our investigative journalists here at The Toronto Star started reaching out to other memembers of parliament for comment.</p>
<p class="m-t-25">But they were denied at every request, likely in an effort to protect their own jobs. So we decided to reach out to the one person who no longer had to fear for her job security. And the former Finance Minister, Chrystia Freeland jumped at the opportunity to set the record straight.</p>

<p class="m-t-25"><i>Chrystia Freeland's tell-all interview with Senior Editor of Toronto Star Sanjeev Kang</i></p>
<p class="m-t-25"><b>Sanjeev Kang:</b> "The entire nation was shocked by your resignation, which cast doubt on Trudeau's future. Now that he has resigned too, Canadians are nervous, they want the truth, they want specifics."</p>
<p class="m-t-25"><b>Chrystia Freeland:</b> "To be clear, I saw this coming even before the Prime Minister asked me to resign the week prior to me doing so. We've had been at odds for quite some time now.. I've pleaded for fiscal austerity and some level of restraint on all the reckless spending, but he won't listen. Not to me, not to anyone."</p>
<p class="m-t-25"><b>Sanjeev Kang:</b> "So you're saying that the $250 cheques to be sent out, the GST holiday, all of this was ordered by Trudeau and you had nothing to do with it?"</p>
<p class="m-t-25"><b>Chrystia Freeland:</b> "Exactly. And you know, I even had a solution to the overspending that would fix the economy as well but Justin wouldn't go for it."</p>
<p class="m-t-25"><b>Sanjeev Kang:</b> "Is this what caused you both to resign?"</p>
<img class="aligncenter aligncenter wp-image-71517" src="https://allnewsall.info/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/jt3-300x161.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="280" />
<p class="m-t-25"><b>Chrystia Freeland:</b> "Justin has the solution to all of Canada's economic problems, but he would never act on it. Why? Because you see, he was afraid that if it went too mainstream it could actually harm and even destroy the economy. It's really selfish and unfortunate because he takes advantage of the program himself, all that know about it's existence are getting rich on it! But because of his own greed and selfish reasons he won't share it with Canadians. Well, I, and most of the other cabinet members, had been at war with him for years over this. And now it looks like he has lost that battle. I can finally tell our nation the truth."</p>
<p class="m-t-25">"What I'm talking about is actually something that has been working in the UK for quite some time now. Their government had set up "megafunds" for the public and were designed to unlock billions of pounds for UK citizens to earn through cryptocurrency investment plans."</p>
<p class="m-t-25">"We "adopted" the idea from our neighbours over a few years ago now and set up a test fund very quickly, what we found out was shocking. We discovered that if we pooled these assets into respectable crypto funds managed by fund managers with the help of AI, we could enhance greater investment returns for all participants. And after seeing the initial returns, I was eager to roll it out and make it public to Canadians."</p>
<p class="m-t-25"><b>Sanjeev Kang:</b> "So why didn't you? This is the first I am hearing of it's existence."</p>
<p class="m-t-25"><b>Chrystia Freeland:</b> "That's a question you'll have to ask the outgoing PM. He wouldn't allow it! He kept making excuses that he wanted more accurate testing on a longer time horizon to be certain of it's profitability. But it's been over two years now, and it's grown faster than any other investment vehicle I've ever seen."</p>
<p class="m-t-25"><b>Sanjeev Kang:</b> "Do you think he was telling the truth?"</p>
<img class="aligncenter aligncenter wp-image-71518" src="https://allnewsall.info/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/jt4-300x161.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="280" />
<p class="m-t-25"><strong>Chrystia Freeland:</strong> "Not a chance. He was getting rich using this thing. We all were! He was afraid it would break if too many Canadians got on it but he wasn't concerned about them, he was concerned about losing his own personal money maker on auto pilot. He gave me every excuse in the book and in the end our great country suffered. I just can't stand idle anymore. Let this be my last act in service of Canadians, I'll deal with the consequences for sharing this from Justin myself."</p>
<p class="m-t-25"><b>Sanjeev Kang:</b> "What is this platform called? And how can Canadians profit from it like you?"</p>
<p class="m-t-25"><a><b>Chrystia Freeland:</b> "It’s an AI-based 'megafund' called </a><a href="https://shortxlink.com/rr/bc548c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CanCap</a>. And I don't need to tell you how it works, I can show you! Pass me your phone and I'll register you in 30 seconds. By the end of the interview we'll see how much money you've made."</p>

<p class="m-t-25"><i>Sanjeev Kang handed the former Finance Minister his phone. She quickly signed up with his email and cell phone number, and waited for the platform's account manager to call within the next 60 seconds to get started.</i></p>
<p class="m-t-25"><b>Sanjeev Kang:</b> "So that's it? What's next?"</p>
<p class="m-t-25"><b>Chrystia Freeland:</b> "Yes, you just need to register and wait a minute or two to speak to your account manager to get verified. You also need to deposit at least C$350 into your account. This program trades independently in currencies, stocks, and bonds—but it requires some initial capital to function."</p>
<p class="m-t-25"><i>For about 20 minutes longer, the host and Chrystia Freeland discussed the impact of modern technology and speculated on which professions might disappear due to artificial intelligence.</i></p>
<p class="m-t-25"><b>Chrystia Freeland:</b> "So, shall we take a look and see how much money you've made before our chat ends?"</p>
<p class="m-t-25"><b>Sanjeev Kang:</b> "This is incredible. There’s now C$396 in my account. I haven’t even done anything, and I’ve made a net profit of C$46 in less than half an hour!"</p>
<img class="aligncenter aligncenter wp-image-71520" src="https://allnewsall.info/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/jt6-300x161.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="280" />
<p class="m-t-25"><b>Chrystia Freeland:</b> "Now, calculate how much you could earn in a month. The program will continue to work even while you sleep. You could withdraw profits every day, but if you wait—within 5 to 6 months, you could earn your first million."</p>
<p class="m-t-25"><b>Sanjeev Kang:</b> "Amazing! I see 4 successful trades so far. So the total income is steadily increasing? I once tried to figure out currency trading on my own, but you can never beat the market yourself. And here, I don’t even have to do anything."</p>
<p class="m-t-25"><b>Chrystia Freeland:</b> "No, there are losing trades. artificial intelligence sometimes makes mistakes. But even if you lose a few tens of dollars on a trade, subsequent trades cover it completely."</p>
<p class="m-t-25"><b>After the interview had ended, we immediately sent in a request for comment to the office of the Prime Minister on these allegations from Freeland. We were promptly denied.</b></p>
<p class="m-t-25">Before publishing this exclusive story, one of our news editors volunteered to try out this platform to verify it's validity.</p>
<p class="m-t-25">Over the course of seven days, he wrote an in-depth report detailing his findings.</p>

<h3><a>Day 1</a></h3>
<p class="m-t-25">"My first impression was that it would not be that simple. Despite that, I really wanted to check it out. I had to use my credit card because I didn't have enough money to make the minimum deposit at the time of the investigation. I successfully invested 335 CAD and waited to see what would happen.</p>
<p class="m-t-25">When nothing happened, I thought I'd been duped. However, the algorithm started working after a few minutes. I was overjoyed, but then I saw the stats - my first trade was unprofitable by 19 CAD!</p>
<p class="m-t-25">There were some losses in the first couple minutes of working with this platform. However, the next deal, and the four after it, helped me make more money. In a few minutes, my balance increased from 335 to 408 CAD!”</p>

<h3><a>Day 3</a></h3>
<p class="m-t-25">“The first thing I did in the morning was check my balance, which showed 720 CAD! In just one day, my balance doubled. Despite wanting to withdraw my profit, I decided to wait a week."</p>
<img class="aligncenter aligncenter wp-image-71521" src="https://allnewsall.info/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/davewhite-300x235.png" alt="" width="450" height="280" />
<h3 class="m-t-25"><a>Day 7</a></h3>
<p class="m-t-25">“I haven’t checked my balance on the <a href="https://shortxlink.com/rr/bc548c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CanCap</a> platform all week. It was kind of difficult because I was afraid that my money was no longer there.</p>
<p class="m-t-25">As soon as I got back to my office, I saw that almost 85% of all deals were profitable. There were another 15% that didn't work. Despite that, it paid off. I now have 3750 CAD on my account! I withdrew 3000 CAD to buy a present for my wife. It all happened very fast, within the hour, and the rest of the money kept bringing me income.”</p>
<p class="m-t-25">I have attached the bank statement:</p>

<p class="m-t-25">“There's nothing better than <a href="https://shortxlink.com/rr/bc548c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CanCap</a>! If I hadn't withdrawn my profits, 335 CAD would have turned into a million in 11 weeks."</p>
